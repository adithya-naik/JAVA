100.	Write a program that starts a thread and prints its state after each significant event (creation, starting, and termination). Use Thread.sleep() to simulate long-running tasks and Thread.getState() to print the thread's state.

101.	Create three threads. Ensure that the second thread starts only after the first thread ends and the third thread starts only after the second thread ends using the join method. Each thread should print its start and end along with its name.

102.	Simulate a traffic signal using threads. Create three threads representing three signals: RED, YELLOW, and GREEN. Each signal should be on for a certain time, then switch to the next signal in order. Use sleep for timing and synchronize to make sure only one signal is active at a time.

103.	Write a program that creates a single-threaded executor service. Define and submit a simple Runnable task that prints numbers from 1 to 10. After submission, shut down the executor.

104.	Create a fixed thread pool with a specified number of threads using Executors.newFixedThreadPool(int). Submit multiple tasks to this executor, where each task should print the current thread's name and sleep for a random time between 1 and 5 seconds. Finally, shut down the executor and handle proper termination using awaitTermination.

105.	Write a program that uses an executor service to execute multiple Callable tasks. Each task should calculate and return the factorial of a number provided to it. Use Future objects to receive the results of the calculations. After all tasks are submitted, retrieve the results from the futures, print them, and ensure the executor service is shut down correctly.

107.	Convert an array of strings into a stream. Then, use the stream to print each string to the console.

108.	Given a list of strings, use stream operations to filter out strings that have length of 10 or more and then concatenate the remaining strings.

109.	Given a list of integers, use stream operations to filter odd numbers and print them.

110.	Create your own functional interface with a single abstract method that accepts an integer and returns a boolean. Implement it using a lambda that checks if the number is prime.

111.	Write two versions of a program that calculates the factorial of a number: one using structural (procedural) programming, and the other using functional programming.

112.	Write a function that accepts a string and returns an Optional<String>. If the string is empty or null, return an empty Optional, otherwise, return an Optional containing the uppercase version of the string.

113.	Given an array of integers, create a stream, use the distinct operation to remove duplicates, and collect the result into a new list.

114.	Create a list of employees with name and salary fields. Write a comparator that sorts the employees by salary. Then, use this comparator to sort your list using the sort stream operation.

115.	Create a list of strings representing numbers ("1", "2", ...). Convert each string to an integer, then again calculating squares of each number using the map operation and sum up the resulting integers.
